To configure libqttracker, in the top-level directory run:

  qmake PREFIX=/usr         # to specify installation prefix (default: /usr/local)
  qmake CONFIG+=coverage    # to allow code coverage measurement
  qmake CONFIG+=timestamps  # to print timestamps at certain key places
  qmake CONFIG+=profile     # to build with profiling enabled
  qmake CONFIG+=noopt       # to build without optimizations, debug mode

Then the following make targets are available in the top level directory:

  make                      # to build the library and its tests
  make doc                  # to build the documentation
  make dev-doc              # to build developer documentation
  make check                # to run regression tests
  make coverage-report      # to create a coverage report with lcov
                            # (available only with CONFIG+=coverage)
  make import_ontologies    # to import fresh tracker ontologies
  make autogenerate         # to regenerate ontology headers from rdf-xml
  make install              # to install the package
  make uninstall            # to undo installation
  make performance_tests    # run performance tests


Note: import_ontologies requires to have a running tracker instance and
      installed libqttracker (?), and generates ontology files in
      data/rdf-xml/QtTracker/ontologies/*.xml

Warning: if you run `qmake' in any subdirectory, the arguments (like PREFIX)
         given at top-level are lost, unless they are specified again.
