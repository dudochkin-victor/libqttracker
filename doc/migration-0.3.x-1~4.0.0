  QtTracker 0.3.x to 1~4.0.0 migration

	1. Intro

1~4.0.0 has seen a lot of internal changes and ABI breaks, and couple 
API breaks, migration changes are described below. Some API features
are deprecated, these are marked as DEPRECATED 0.3.x, and they will 
be supported until 1~5.0.0.


	2. API Migration changes:

	2.1. Implicit inclusion of ontology headers will be dropped.

// === Including <QtTracker/QTracker> has all ontologies and is slow.
#include <QtTracker/QTracker>
// >>> replace with the slim header and specific ontology headers
// >>> f.ex. nco and nfo:
#include <QtTracker/Tracker>
#include <QtTracker/ontologies/nco.h>
#include <QtTracker/ontologies/nfo.h>
// ===


	2.2. Dropping get* prefix from property accessors as per Qt policy.

// === RDFGraph::getService >>> RDFGraph::service ===
// === RDFGraph::getGraphIri >>> RDFGraph::graphIri ===
